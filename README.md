# rubin-lc-simulator
A lightweight Python package for simulating time-domain light curves with Rubin/LSST cadence and photometric uncertainty. Supports sky-position-dependent cadence extraction via rubin_sim, customizable light curve injection using the LSST Camera's six optical filters (ugrizy), and realistic noise modeling based on Rubinâ€™s five sigma depth.
